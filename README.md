# Speaker Tracker 
- a multi-platform version of the [Mac app](https://github.com/wrmack/SpeakerTracker) was built with [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).
- the ongoing development of this app is now built with [Tauri](https://tauri.app)

Speaker Tracker is a desktop app to help with managing formal meetings where, in a debate:

- members of the meeting signal to the chair their wish to speak and they are placed on a list of those waiting to speak
- it is necessary to track those who have spoken so they do not speak again if the meeting rules limit each member to one speech
- there are meeting rules that limit speaking time and speeches need to be timed.

It is ideal for local government meetings.
